# Crimson Desert compact inventory

A native ASI mod that fits eight columns and eleven rows into the inventory and Private Storage screens. Tiles measure 64 by 62.5 pixels. Category artwork, empty slots, hover, and focus effects follow the compact layout. A list-mode toggle is not implemented.

Revision 5 was verified in game by the user on Steam build `26317560`. The runtime replaces exact decoded UI resources in memory and leaves signed archives, indexes, and saves untouched.

Steam has since updated the local game to build `26329202`, EXE version `1.0.0.3446`. That EXE is unsupported here. The installed mod correctly disables itself on its different fingerprint. Compatibility requires a separate audit of the native methods and assets.

This repository contains source, transform rules, hash pins, fixtures, and build instructions. It contains no game assets, generated payload headers, or executable downloads. Build packages contain game-derived data and must remain local.
